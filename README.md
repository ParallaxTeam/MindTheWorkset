## Credits
Credit for this idea goes to [Purvi Irwin](https://twitter.com/BIMchiq).

## Price
This app is provided "as-is" for free and open source. This is made possible thanks to [Parallax Team's](https://www.parallaxteam.com/) commitment to sharing knowledge. There is an installer available in [releases](https://github.com/johnpierson/MindTheWorkset/releases), but this project is very much "use at your own risk", please pay attention to the [license](#license) below.

## Usage
After installing the application from the [releases](https://github.com/johnpierson/MindTheWorkset/releases) section, it will just run any time Revit is open. The only times it will alert the user are as follows:
1. When Opening a workshared document
2. When synchronize with central is complete.
